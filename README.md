# Tabular-Playground-Series---Jul-2021
In this competition you are predicting the values of air pollution measurements over time, based on basic weather information (temperature and humidity) and the input values of 5 sensors.

The three target values to you to predict are: target_carbon_monoxide, target_benzene, and target_nitrogen_oxides

Files

train.csv - the training data, including the weather data, sensor data, and values for the 3 targets
test.csv - the same format as train.csv, but without the target value; your task is to predict the value for each of these targets.
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format.
